# What does Eventik do?

Eventik is a pocket event organizer that offers a seamless event planning experience.

As a user, you can create your events, search for services associated with the type of event you want to create, request quotes, inquire for more information regarding the quote, and confirm them. When you confirm a service, it gets added to your event's planning, and you can chat with the provider to finalize details.

You can create an event in one place and enjoy the process of organizing it, stress-free!

# Why is Eventik useful?

Because you can create an event in a centralized way without having to search for services on multiple platforms, Eventik also allows you to keep track of the cost of the event through the confirmed quotes.

Furthermore, you won't waste time searching among thousands of service providers because you will only see those that are relevant to the type of event you have chosen. For example, if you are planning a children's birthday party, you won't see providers who offer services for farewells or other unrelated events.

All of this makes event planning simple and an enjoyable experience, free from stress.

# How does it work?
## If you want to organize an Event
1. You can navigate the home page and view all the supplier’s offers by clicking on “Ver todos”.  Once you are on the suppliers' index, you can either view all service providers or filter by service type, for example, catering, venues, etc. Additionally, you can see the details of each supplier by clicking on it, without being logged in. However, if you want to inquire about further details of a service or request a quote, you need to be logged in.

4. The purpose is to enhance the user experience so that when you choose, for example, to organize an event of the type "Children's Birthday," only the suppliers who offer services associated with that type of event will be displayed. This way, users can easily find relevant suppliers based on their event preferences.
5. To create an event, you need to give it a name, specify the date and the address.

From there, you can continue adding more services by requesting quotations from as many suppliers as you want for the event. Simply repeat the previous steps to consult with multiple suppliers and gather the necessary quotations. You can consult and respond to these quotations at any time from the "Quotations" column (eye icon) that corresponds to the event.
